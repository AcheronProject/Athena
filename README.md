# Acheron Athena

## Introduction

Athena is a tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) which main feature is the multi-layout support. Athena supports:

- 87 (F12) or 88 (F13) TKL function rows;
- ANSI and ISO layouts
- 7U and 6.25U spacebar bottom row layouts
- Split backspace
- Split right shift

Below is a [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://keyboard-layout-editor.com/) image of the layouts Athena supports.

In [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gondolindrim/file_hosting/main/athena/athena_KLE.json) there is a KLE JSON file for the layout.

Both Apollo and Athena line of PCBs were designed to be "universal" TKL PCBs, that is, designed to fit a wide variety of custom mechanical keyboards. The compatibility list is being built as more people check and test. See the **Keyboard compatibility** section of this README for the available list.

## Keyboard compatibility

## Known compatibilities

- **Geonworks F1-8X and F1-6X:** confirmed by Geon, who tested the PCB 3D files against the case 3D files. Live hardware testing into a machined case is pending.

### Known incompatibilities

- **ai03 KBD8X MKII**: ai03 open-sourced the PCB files for his KBD8X. Alghtough Apollo's edges do fit inside the original PCB's, its connector is more protruded then the original PCB's.

- **PrismA18**: different layouts on the function row.

## Acknowledgements

- The first prototypes of this PCB were paid for and tested by KeebsForAll, who also intends to make units of this PCB available for purchase.

- Geon, who kindly spent time helping design this PCB to fit his keyboards.
